## 📋 Overview

**Veda is not just a chatbot, but a complete social welfare ecosystem** designed to bridge the gap between citizens and government benefits. An advanced **n8n workflow integration** serves as the platform’s core, acting as the intelligent brain behind every process.

While traditional apps rely on static, outdated databases, Veda utilizes **Crawl4AI** for real-time web scraping, continuously extracting live data directly from government portals. This guarantees that our AI assistant operates with 100% accuracy, powered by realtime, verified data. By automating data verification through n8n, Instead of navigating complex paperwork, Veda gives users a clear, personalized path to the benefits they deserve.
